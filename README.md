# Scoreboard

## To do

- Create utility functions for hover/active/focus effects (e.g. buttons, chips, navigation) `o-interactive`, `o-interactive--active`
  - Challenge: `o-interactive--active` might be applie to `o-interactive` itself (button/chip) or a parent class (bottom nav)
- Do button links properly rather than using `<Link><Button /></Link>`
- Split edit session into different routes for players and details (players in modal?)
- Redesign session view
